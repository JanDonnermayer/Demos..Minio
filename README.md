# Demos..Minio

A synchronization tool which can transfer data between filesystem and minio object-store. High performance is achieved by indexing source and target first, copying selectively.

ToDo:

- ~~Single file transfer & filter~~
- Delete
- Write to Minio
- MD5 for multipart
- Cancellation Tokens
- Error Handling
